# Code Drawer

Code Drawer is an open source free to use Apple Ecosystem code library. You can add anything from a simple function with minimal features, to a full blown project with folders and linked files. I plan to implement an IDE level of syntax highlighting, with functionalities such as showing source for variables, function calls and so forth.

### Roadmap

Currently I am in early development stages, including learning the basics of SwiftUI for MacOS 11/iOS 14
